# Feed archiving using Node.js and CouchDB

This project evolved from a CouchApp that stored PubSubHubbub notifications in CouchDB into a Node.js app that actively fetches feeds and stores them in Couch. Original concept by @tylergillies (Tyler Gillies)

# still a work in progress!

Architecture: a 'parent' node process (couchpubtato.js) monitors a database on a CouchDB for any documents that have both a "feed" and "db" attribute. Anytime it sees a matching document it will spawn a worker that will fetch the url contained within the "feed" attribute and save each item into the local CouchDB specified in the "db" field.

Currently it only works on RSS/ATOM feeds but it is using JSDOM which is capable of HTML parsing so in a future version you will be able to include a javascript function to execute on the fetched DOM.

To try out:

    # install latest node + npm
    # start couchdb
    # clone this repo
    npm install request
    npm install jsdom
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ruby create_test_data.rb http://admin:password@localhost:5894
    node couchpubtato.js http://localhost:5984/nytimes

Then look in the 'articles' database on Couch :)
